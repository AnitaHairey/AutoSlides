# AutoSlides: An LLM Agent for Seamlessly Generating Presentation Slides from Documents

## ðŸŒŸ Abstract

Have you ever grown tired of repeatedly copying content from a paper to slides? **AutoSlides** addresses the common challenge of manually creating presentation slides from `.tex`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` files. Researchers may spend tens of hours curating slides for a conference talk, and ML engineers often need to summarize papers for internal presentations. 

AutoSlides leverages a GPT-powered multi-agent system to automatically extract and structure content, creating polished and well-organized slides. It also integrates figure processing, ensuring seamless visual elements. AutoSlides significantly reduces the time and effort required for slide preparation, making it an invaluable tool for researchers and engineers alike.

## Design & Implementation

### 1. Architecture

AutoSlides uses a modular architecture coordinated by the `MainCaller` module. The general workflow is:

1. `file_loader.py` loads content from the target folder.
2. `content_summarizer.py` uses GPT-4o to summarize the content and generate slide titles and structure.
3. `figure_processor.py` extracts and inserts figures.
4. `slides_generator.py` formats everything into a `.pptx` file.

### 2. Component Overview

#### `main.py`
Entry point of AutoSlides. Orchestrates file loading, summarization, and slide generation.

#### `model.py`
Handles all GPT-4o API calls and returns the model output.

#### `file_loader.py`
Loads and processes `.tex`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` files from a given directory.

#### `content_summarizer.py`
Summarizes documents using GPT-4o and determines slide count and structure. Caches results for efficiency.

#### `figure_processor.py`
Extracts figure data from LaTeX files, calls GPT-4o for descriptions, and integrates selected figures into slides. Converts PDF figures to PNG when necessary.

#### `slides_generator.py`
Generates slides from summarized text, applying appropriate formatting, titles, and images. Saves the presentation as a `.pptx` file.

#### `utils.py`
Provides utility functions for text formatting, markdown parsing, figure rendering, and file manipulation.
