\section{Threats to Validity} \label{sec:threats}

A major threat to external validity is that the maven corpus we used during post-processing does not include all Java libraries.
This corpus contains Java libraries and descriptions until 2022, so new libraries or private ones are not contained in this corpus and cannot be generated by \detector{}.
This threat could be reduced by extending this corpus with the libraries used by the developers themselves.
The threats to internal validity are instrumentation effects that can bias our results. Faults in our tool or its underlying third-party tools (e.g., the entity-linking approaches for library recommendation) might cause such effects. 
To reduce these threats, we manually inspect the intermediate results to make sure that the accuracy of their recommended libraries is quite similar to the reported values in their paper~\cite{vullib}.
